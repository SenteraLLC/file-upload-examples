# attaching the file to something like a field, survey, feature set,
# mosaic, etc.
#
# Full documentation of this workflow can be found here:

# This method demonstrates how to use the ID of a file that

# of the mutations in Sentera's GraphQL API that accepts a
# file ID as an input. In this example, we'll use the
# import_feature_set GraphQL mutation to attach the file to
# a feature set owned by the specified file owner
#
# @param [string] file_id ID of the uploaded file
# @param [string] owner_type Type of owner that will own the
#                            feature set. For example: SURVEY.
# @param [string] owner_sentera_id Sentera ID of the resource
#                           (field, survey, feature set, etc.)
#                           that will own the feature set that
#                           is created.
